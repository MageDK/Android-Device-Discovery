Android-Device-Discovery
========================

http://emildiego.com/android-device-discovery/

A library for querying an Android device about the hardware on the device.  (CPU usage, memory, network, display, 
processes, etc)

The Android Device Discovery library came about from another Android application I was working on. The System Profiler 
app allows you view detailed information about your device and see all the processes currently running. After I received 
a lot of questions about how to query the device for certain types on information so I decided to take that core 
functionality and wrap it up as a stand alone project.

You can download the System Profiler app (emildiego.com/systemprofiler) from 
Google Play: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.emildiego.systemProfiler&hl=en
and 
Amazon App Store: http://www.amazon.com/Emil-Diego%60%60-System-Profiler/dp/B00CRJT6NY/ref=sr_1_1?s=mobile-apps&ie=UTF8&qid=1390497929&sr=1-1&keywords=system+profiler
